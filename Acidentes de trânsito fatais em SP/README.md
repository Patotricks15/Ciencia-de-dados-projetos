## Summary
Urban mobility is a much-discussed and always current topic, and among the numerous social and cultural challenges faced by Brazilian society, traffic accidents are one of the most significant, as they put the lives of vehicle drivers, as well as pedestrians and passengers, at risk, drastically increasing the number of victims. Therefore, it is essential that public authorities and civil society are attentive to the causes and consequences of this sad reality.

**Keywords:** Accidents, mobility, society, traffic

## Objective
This project aims to explore data on fatal accidents in SP from 2015 to 2020, as one of the problems that the State of São Paulo deals with is the high number of traffic accidents. Here I seek to answer essential questions so that society can demand public policies that reduce the number of fatal accidents and so that the authorities can offer us such public policies.

## Methodology
**Exploratory Data Analysis (PYTHON)**

When analyzing a social problem, we must ask many questions because they are usually complex problems that result from numerous factors and affect many people. Given the limitations of our dataset, we will answer four questions:

* WHO?
* WHERE?
* WHEN?
* HOW?

## Conclusion
Knowing what happens in our daily lives is essential not only to understand our society but also to feel part of it. Analyzing phenomena (no matter how tragic they are) through data, graphs, and models is part of this understanding, and therefore, the data must be clear, and the graphs must be cohesive, as they need to be understood and for that, they need to be comprehensible.

It is the duty of citizens and public bodies (especially the latter) to raise awareness that traffic must be conducted responsibly. Traffic education is not only acquired in driving schools but also in a community aware of the seriousness of the matter.

“If there is a human failure, both the road and the vehicle are there to assist and mitigate the fatal injury to the occupant. If we do not work on the issue of education and the behavior of society, we will continue to have high rates of traffic deaths,” says José Aurélio Ramalho.
