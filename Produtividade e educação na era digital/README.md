## Abstract
Technologies have been shaping the way we interact in various layers of our lives, and it is no different in education and how we manage our tasks. Digital devices are on the cusp of being both heroes and villains when it comes to education and productivity.
Therefore, it is necessary to understand how to use these technologies so that we can take full advantage of them, leveraging their benefits and evolving the way of teaching and working.

Keywords: productivity, education, technology, apps

## Objective
This study aims to examine apps focused on education and productivity, in order to gather information about these products in the virtual market. This way, we can better contemplate the future of technologies in education and work.

## Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis [PYTHON]

Only apps from the "EDUCATION" and "PRODUCTIVITY" categories will be selected, followed by an exploratory data analysis. The main focus will be on the number of apps, average ratings, and the number of reviews.

## Conclusion
Productivity apps are present in the virtual store in much larger quantities than education apps, which is due to productivity being a much broader aspect. It spans from education to work life, covering aspects of day-to-day productivity. Meanwhile, education is very focused on what it proposes to do.
Society has been shaping itself as technologies evolve, and education cannot be left behind. The presence of education and productivity apps shows that technologies can facilitate our lives in studies and work, allowing us to increasingly optimize our time, our information, and our cognitive abilities.
