## Abstract
In an era of connectivity, the government must constantly update itself and inform its institutions and citizens. The government needs to be adept at handling social changes brought about by technological innovations, and take advantage of these innovations to facilitate societal coexistence. The topic addressed here was urban violence, and this should be leveraged with the ultimate goal of making public policies more efficient and reaching even the most inaccessible places.

## Objective
The purpose of this study is to show how technologies can assist governments in understanding how their social structures function, and help the population to prevent crime by giving them an idea of how dangerous a certain location can be.

## Methodology
Using the "Onde fui roubado?" platform, we will analyze crime in São Paulo (with data up until early 2018). Guiding our analysis makes us more precise when studying a problem, therefore, I seek to answer the following questions:

- Who was robbed?
- What was stolen?
- Where was it stolen?
- When was it stolen?

## Conclusion
The government must constantly update itself and inform its institutions and citizens. The government needs to be adept at handling social changes brought about by technological innovations, and take advantage of these innovations to facilitate societal coexistence. The topic addressed here was urban violence, but innovations are arriving in various areas (communication, employment, sanitation, culture, leisure, urban mobility, etc.) and this should be leveraged with the ultimate goal of making public policies more efficient and reaching even the most inaccessible places.

Society can take advantage of this if there are partnerships dedicated to informing citizens about what is happening in their territory and within society itself. Informing about violence is crucial for those who want to reduce these numbers, and being informed is important for those who want to avoid being robbed. Therefore, it is in the citizen's interest to be informed, and it should be the obligation of the government and its institutions to inform.

*"Innovation is not just about using technology. Technology can be a means, but seeing and transforming a way of doing something, changing the way we face challenges, all this can be seen and done in an innovative way."* - Gustavo Maia
