## Introduction
The Coronavirus pandemic has left marks of tragedy on many families, companies, and countries. This would be no different in the financial market, where expectations influence decision-making. Political changes, global catastrophes, and pandemics can change investors' expectations about the future of certain financial assets, stock exchanges, and companies.

Brazil experienced (and still experiences) dangerous times during this pandemic. We are one of the countries with the highest number of cases per million inhabitants, the second with the highest number of deaths. And we still do not have a vaccination plan. Uncertainty in Brazil is still high, and this affects the market. The Brazilian market saw the return on equity — one of the indicators used to measure a company's performance — fall over the months during this pandemic.

The objective of this project is to analyze the behavior of some assets. The analysis will be by price and return (which is interpreted from volatility). For this, I selected 5 financial assets from different sectors (BANCO DO BRASIL, PETROBRÁS, GOL, MAGAZINE LUIZA, and COGNA EDUCAÇÃO).

## Methodology
We will use exploratory data analysis techniques to analyze financial data, such as descriptive statistics and visualizations. It will be an investigation into the behavior of the financial market, so we will explore some concepts related to this topic.

The programming language used to develop the metrics and graphs was Python.

The analysis is divided as follows:

The first part is reserved for the analysis of prices throughout 2020, exploring simple metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation.

The second part is dedicated to studying the volatility (return) of financial assets. And using the same metrics from the first part of the project, we will be able to compare the information on prices and volatility.

The third part is where we will analyze the IBOVESPA, its prices and volatility, and compare it with the assets studied before. We will check the correlations using description and visualization.

Lastly, we will conclude our analysis by providing an overview of the current pandemic context.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of this project, we can conclude what was already known: the coronavirus crisis shook the financial market, causing panic for a certain period, but has since calmed down. Looking at the metrics, we can see that the stock market followed the price and volatility of some assets, both falling in the same period, the period of greatest uncertainty and misinformation.

We are living in an unparalleled moment, which has devastated health systems, lives, families. Education stopped, the lives of many people stopped, companies did not survive, families were separated. An analysis of the financial market is very little to understand what this pandemic has caused in Brazil and the world.

Now with the vaccine, we are closer to controlling the contagion, and thus we will be able to embrace again, visit relatives and friends. And when stability returns, companies will re-emerge, parents and children will reunite, and markets will recover.
